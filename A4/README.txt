1) Place the cancer_dataset.csv dataset in the same directory where the python program (a4.py) is placed.

Follow these steps to run the code file (a4.py)-

1) Install virtualenv in python using "pip install virtualenv".
2) Create a virtual environment using virtualenv in python. I used PyCharm for this purpose, but you can also use command line interface in Linux.
3) Install pandas, scikit-learn and matplotlib in the virtual environment. You can use PyCharm directly, or otherwise use pip to install these in case of command line interface.
4) Run the program file using PyCharm or python in command line ("python3 a4.py").
5) By default, you should see the 'Accuracy vs k' plots corresponding to different distance metrics one by one.
