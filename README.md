# Machine-Intelligence-and-Expert-Systems
The Solution for Machine Intelligence and Expert Systems Assignments (EC60091) Autumn 2020 at IIT Kharagpur. This repository is organized as follows-

- A1 - Train and test a decision tree classifier on the Fisher Iris dataset.
- A2 - Cluster the given dataset using K-means clustering and visualize the clusters for different test cases.
- A3 - Design and implement a Neural Network for classification of Fisher's Iris data to predict the species of Iris flower.
- A4 - Implement a function to return k-Nearest Neighbours, to predict the class of the Test dataset for different distance metrics and different values of k.
